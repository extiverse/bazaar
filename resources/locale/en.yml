                           By allowing cronjobs to process Bazaar tasks, these processes
                           are less likely to timeout. Please note you need to be able to
                           configure the cronjob, refer to <a>the wiki</a>.

                    Connect your Flarum forum to your personal account on {host} to unlock advanced features; including
                    a dashboard that gives you an health overview of all your connected Flarum installations. We will
                    add more functionality like notifications when your forum contains outdated extensions or the ability
                    to update all Flarum installations centrally.

                        It seems Bazaar has insufficient permissions to write files
                        and/or directories, please review the list below. For further

                    description: >
                        We recommend allowing PHP to use at least {required} of memory, your php.ini currently allows {limit}.
                        Although we try to increase the memory limit during runtime, success depends on your hosting environment.
