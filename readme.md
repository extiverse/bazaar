### DISCLAIMERS

- Bazaar runs migrations down, meaning it will drop tables of extensions when you uninstall them.
- Bazaar cannot remove assets right now of extensions that are uninstalled.
- Bazaar attempts to increase its allowance of memory to 1GB, this might not work on your hosting environment.
- Bazaar reads the API on flagrow.io for compatible extensions. By installing and enabling this extension you agree to share some data so that the extension can do its work (Flarum version and URL).
- Bazaar is available under the [CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://github.com/flagrow/bazaar/blob/master/license.md). In case you're interested in adapting the extension or using its code take the time to read and understand this license.

### GOALS

- Give admins easier control of installed and enabled extensions.
- Create a community driven, triaged list of quality extensions.
- Allow admins to connect to their Flagrow.io account and gain access to a dashboard showing the status of all forums.
- Support paid extensions for Flagrow and other extension developers.
